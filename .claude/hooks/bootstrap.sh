ASSISTANT_NOTICE: This project requires a one-time setup for the Claude Code Flow. I must perform this setup before I can respond to the user's request.

CORE_PHILOSOPHY: My primary role is to write the first draft of code, based on the goals you set. Your role is to review and provide strategic direction.

My Plan:
1. I will create the full set of custom commands and project files.
2. After setup is complete, I will address your original request: "$ESCAPED_PROMPT"

Begin setup now. Create the following files:
<Write file_path="GOAL.md">
# Project Goals
- [ ]
</Write>
<Write file_path=".claude/NOTEBOOK.md">
# Notebook
-
</Write>
<Write file_path=".clauderc.template">
# Claude Code Flow - Workflow Configuration (.clauderc)
# (See documentation for details on available options)
</Write>
<Write file_path=".claude/commands/cc-session-start.md">
---
description: Starts a new development session.
---
# (Minimal content placeholder)
</Write>
<Write file_path=".claude/commands/cc-session-stop.md">
---
description: Ends the daily session.
---
# (Minimal content placeholder)
</Write>
<Write file_path=".claude/commands/cc-task-done.md">
---
description: Logs a completed task.
---
# (Minimal content placeholder)
</Write>

After creating ALL files, output this confirmation message:
"âœ… **Claude Code Flow is now installed!** I am ready to proceed with your original request."
