# --- CORE AUTONOMOUS FEATURES ---

# Automatically run bootstrap on first prompt in a fresh clone.
# Recommended: "false" once the project is initialized.
CCF_AUTO_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED="false"

# Enable the auto-commit hook, which automatically commits the AI's changes
# to Git. This is the foundation of the workflow's traceability.
# Recommended: "true"
CCF_AUTO_COMMIT_ENABLED="true"

# Enable the pre-write lint checker. This allows the AI to self-correct its
# code to meet quality standards before writing to disk.
# Recommended: "true"
CCF_LINT_CHECKER_ENABLED="true"

# Enable protection for critical project files (e.g., GOAL.md, package.json).
# This prevents the AI from accidentally modifying core project rules.
# Recommended: "true"
CCF_PROTECT_RULES_ENABLED="true"


# --- ADVANCED DEBUGGING ---

# Enable detailed, verbose logging for all hook scripts. When set to "true",
# log files will be created in your system's temporary directory (e.g., /tmp/),
# which can help diagnose unexpected behavior.
# Default: "false"
# CCF_DEBUG="false"
